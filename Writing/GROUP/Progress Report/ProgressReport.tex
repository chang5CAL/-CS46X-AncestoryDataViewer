\section{Project Overview }
\begin{singlespace}
The purpose of our project is to read in a GEDCOM file and display its information onto an ancestry tree. The GEDCOM file needs to be parsed through to make it easier for the software to read and to gather the required data. The ancestry tree will be displayed in a clear graph that contains series of parent and children nodes. The software has two applications: desktop and VR. A user should be able to toggle between desktop and VR mode if a VR headset is presented. In addition, the following special features should be included in the software: choosing a subsection of the tree, finding a common ancestor between two nodes (members), and toggling between a full ancestry tree and a direct lineage tree.
\end{singlespace}

\section{Current Status}
\begin{singlespace}
Before we talk about our current status, we should briefly talk about what we have completed so far. We mainly wrote four documents for this project: problem statement, requirements document, technology review and design document.
\begin{itemize}
\item The problem statement is to identify the purpose of the project and get an idea of why our client had us build this software.
\item The requirements document is to identify functionalities required by the client for the software to develop and slightly touch on what we need to do for the project. This document basically displays what the client wants as the result of our project. 
\item The technology review is to identify the different parts of the software and research on tools we can use for the different parts.
\item The design document is to illustrate how the different parts of the technology review are put together and create our software. We have to justify our choices for each part to support our design. (The client could access these documents because we required signatures for the documents.)
\end{itemize}
 

After we finish the documents, we have designed what we envision our software to look like and have a basic understanding of how we plan on doing it. We are currently transitioning from documentation to development. We could start on the development after our client approves our design documents. Our next course of action would be implementing our parser code and to get familiar with display features on Unreal Engine. Since it is not productive for all of us be working on the parser and we don't have a working parser ready, we will be using some fake data to test our implementation of visualization algorithm, etc.

\subsection{Week 7}
\subsubsection{Plans}
We need to start on technology review.

\subsubsection{Problems}
Coming up with nine components to the software.

\subsubsection{Progress}
During week 7, we started on our technology review document after we finished the requirements document. We met as a group and come up with different components for the software, but we weren't able to come up with nine components. We went to our instructor's office hour and got a few helpful advice from him, but still didn't meet the required nine components. We went on our own after we distributed the components because the technology review is an individual assignment. Each of us researched on tools for each component that we are in charge of but we also mention that we have the option of implementing our own tool for some components.  


\subsection{Week 8}
\subsubsection{Plans}
Do more research on the components each of us are in charge of and continue working on the technology review document.

\subsubsection{Problems}
Coming up with nine components to the software.
\subsubsection{Progress}
During week 8, we finished our research on the components that we came up with. We chose a tool for each component and justified our choice base on the research we have done. We continue to brainstorm ideas for the components of the software but didn't come up with anything. On Tuesday of this week, we paired review with our other classmates and revise the document. We met with our TA on Wednesday and he helped us come up with more components to the software and we got our nine required components. We then did more research on the new components separately.

\subsection{Week 9}
\subsubsection{Plans}
Do more research on the components each of us are in charge of and finish the technology review document.
\subsubsection{Problems}
N/A
\subsubsection{Progress}
At the beginning of week 9, we are mostly finished with research and our technology review document. We finalized and revised our technology review document. The technology review document is turned in on Tuesday. We sent a copy to our instructor and uploaded to GitHub. We didn't have class this week due to Thanksgiving. We didn't do more work for this class and enjoyed our long holiday weekend. 

\subsection{Week 10}
\subsubsection{Plans}
We are meet and write the design document.
\subsubsection{Problems}
N/A
\subsubsection{Progress}
During week 10, we met as a group and went to class to look at examples of the design document. Afterwards, we discussed how to put the components together and develop our design document. After the meeting, we each wrote about the different components that we are in charge of. For each component, we have to write about its functionalities, how it is implemented, and justified why we chose to implement it this way. We added our introduction and conclusion after we finish our parts and turned in the design document. The design document is uploaded to GitHub.
